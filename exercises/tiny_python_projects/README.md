# Tiny Python Projects

Exercises in this directory are based on the Tiny Python Projects book by Youens-Clark.  Getting more rust off.  I like these project based books for brushing up because I can do one or two a day as small daily practice. 

Author's repo for the book can be found at https://github.com/kyclark/tiny_python_projects
